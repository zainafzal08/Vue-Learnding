# Vue-Learnding
A fun workshop on the basics of Vue

## Possible Ideas
If we're going to demo, should just demo live.

I'd say use the Vue-Cli to get started.

So something like.

```bash
npm i -g vue-cli
vue init webpack-simple "My Project"

# Then the usual
npm run dev
```

* BlogTool
* ToDo Tool
* Basic Website (just demo component construction)
* Something else?
